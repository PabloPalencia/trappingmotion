# trappingmotion
R package to integrate movement and behaviour ecology from camera-trapping

Despite a wide range of sensors and biologging devices have been used to monitor movement parameters, camera-traps have been scarcely applied for this purpose. Camera-trapping is a non-invasive methodology with the potential to enlarge the set of species and situations to monitor these parameters. This package includes functions to estimate movement parameters (e.g. day range) from camera-traps data.
